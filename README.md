#LouBuzReview

Louisville Business Review is for reviewing businesses and thier services located in Louisville KY. 
Business is identified based on its website and name.
Initially, website was design to do the review in three steps.
First add reviwer(user) information
  First Name, 
  Last Name, 
  City and 
  State where user lives in
  
Second add business information
  Business Category
  Business Name
  Business Website URL
  
Third add the review; what you think about the quality of business, its product and services 
  Rating
  Review and 
  Date of review
  
However, later I changed the design adding a view model to add all three in one view and it populate three tables in the model. 
Any one can add user information, Business information and review by clicking on Add New Business Review button in the User Reviews 

Added review can be edited using the edit button in the User Reviews page. It will allow user to edit data in the three table at once.

Deleting functionality will delete record related to review from three tables.

All CRUD operation related to the project is under User Review menu item. 
User Profile and Registered Businesses has more detail about users and business information. 
Link to creating data to these two is disabled from the Project.
